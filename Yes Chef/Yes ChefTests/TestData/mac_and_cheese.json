I have a friend requesting it again but I'd have to make it 4 days ahead of time.. is this freezable before baking or do you think I can make it and it will still be ok with the make ahead option 4 days later when they bake it? Or should I bake it and then refrigerate it and they can just reheat it? Please help with what you think my best option is! Thank you so much for the recipe that people are still craving from weeks ago!!!!",
